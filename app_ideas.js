/* Have idea for drop down menu for Best-sellers, high-top, 
designer and then click on menu item to direct you to place on page 
that has section for each item. perhaps on click make image and video size bigger to 
show which item is selected. 

2) on hover play video links 
    May be a good idea to store the video links as an array
     and access them via index?
